# Proyecto-1-Spotify
Team members:

We are a consulting company for independent artists. We are helping a new Mexican artist to launch their next hit in Mexico and Latin America, which is planned to be released in last quarter 2020 in the Spotify platform.

Tasks:
1) Identify most popular music genres in the population segment that the artist is targeting.
2) Identify patterns in the tempo, energy, danceability and acousticness of the music that people in that segment listen to in different quarters.
3) Define the properties that the artist's song should have to be succesful in last quarter 2020 in Mexico and Latin America.
4) Predict how popular this song will be in upcoming quarters.
