# Proyecto-1-Spotify
Team members:

We are a consulting company for independent artists. We are helping a new Mexican artist to launch their next hit in Mexico and Latin America, which is planned to be released in last quarter 2020 in the Spotify platform, to remain in the Top 50 Chart throughout the next year.

Tasks:
1) Identify most popular music genres in the population segment that the artist is targeting.
2) Identify patterns in the tempo, energy, danceability and acousticness of the music that people in that segment listen to in different quarters.
3) Define the properties that the artist's song should have to be succesful in last quarter 2020 in Mexico and Latin America.
4) Predict how popular this song will be in upcoming quarters.

Hypothesis:
If we determine the optimal mix of the variables related to a successful song in Mexico, then we can help the artist release a successful song in the last quarter of 2020:
  1) If the tempo of a song is higher than 100 bpm, then it will be more popular.
  2) If the artist chooses to release a reggaeton song, then it will remain in the Top 50 Chart throughout the next year.
  3) If a song has a higher level of energy, then it will be more likely to be in the Top 50 throughout the next year.
  4) If a song has a higher level of danceability, then it will be more likely to be in the Top 50 throughout the next year.
